# GettingAndCleaning_Assigment

This is Peer-graded Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This Github repo contains following files: README.md, CodeBook.md, run_analysis.R , Tidy_Data.txt, 

 - The README explains the analysis files.
 - The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data. 

 - The R script called run_analysis.R does the following: 
        1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
        5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
 - The Tidy_Data.txt file is the result of all actions performed in R script.
